# Rollup ü§ù Node
This is a small project to integrate Rollup with third party NodeJS packages,
inspired by a bug encountered when rolling up a module that depends on
`chokidar` (which is manually included for this reason).

This `package.json` contains dependencies for the top 109 npm packages. This
project will be complete when Rollup can bundle all of them and they execute
without errors.
