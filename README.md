# Rollup 🤝 Node
This is a small project to integrate Rollup with third party NodeJS packages,
inspired by a bug encountered when rolling up a module that depends on `glob`.

This `package.json` contains dependencies for the top 36 npm packages. This
project will be complete when Rollup can bundle all of them.
